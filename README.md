# Car-Model-Acquisition
The application deals with the carâ€™s acceptability as the primacy. A data set was provided through which the class of the car should be classified. Classification is being carried out through various classification algorithms. In the project 4 algorithms are used and contrasted with the help of visual analysis. The 4 algorithms were Logistic Regression, KNN Algorithm, SVM and Decision Tree. Out of all the algorithms, Output from Decision Tree was promising as it showed a higher accuracy and precision. Here "class" attribute has been classified into one of the four categories i.e., unacc,  acc, vgood, good which actually tells how good a car is and how acceptable it is.
